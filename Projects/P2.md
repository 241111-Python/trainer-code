### "The Data"
Select an external data source. It must:
- Be open in nature (no paid data sources)
- Be available in CSV (comma separated value) or JSON (javascript object notation)
- Contain at least 200 individual entries

### "The Application"
Write a python application to provide an interface and analysis of the data source.  

Technical Requirements:
- The application must be written in Python
- Provide an interactive terminal interface
- Handle any exceptions or errors gracefully
- Let the user continue running the application until they choose to exit the program
- Allow the user to choose which file/source to read data from
- Provide an option to the user to examine individual entries
- Provide an option to the user to examine sets of similar data based on a sort and/or filter functionality

**UPDATE**:
- The application should analyze the objects in the program, and present statistically usefull information.
- The application should be able to export the analysis to a file.
