# P1 - Bash Script
### *Presentations will be Nov. 15*
### *Develop a small bash script*
Some recommendations are:
- flipping a coin
- high-low (guessing a number with the feedback of "higher!" or "lower!")
- rock-paper-scissors

While the specifics of the program are up to you, it should be something  
that you can plan to gather statistics from.  For example, a win/loss tracker, or a leaderboard.

Technical requirements:
- The program must be written as a Bash script.
- You must complete and present your own work:
    - plagerism of any kind will not be tolerated.
    - you may (and are encouraged to) collaborate and assist others in the cohort.
    - AI may be used to assist, not to do the work for you. 
        - asking ChatGPT how to generate a random value is fine.
        - asking ChatGPT to develop a program for you is not.
- The statistics generated must be written to a separate file.
- The program must run without errors.
