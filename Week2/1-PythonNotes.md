# Python
- interpreted language
- user-friendly/ simple syntax/ a lot is abstracted/ intuitive - HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE
    - no pointers/memory management
    - Garbage collection
    - Automatic memory management
- Dynamically typed
    - we don't declare the type
    - we can use annotations to "suggest" what type to use
- Strongly typed - we cannot implicitiy coerce a variable type ("Hello" + 100)

- we can run python from the terminal
    ```python <file-name>```
